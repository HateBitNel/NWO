# NWO

This project was only made possible because we worked great as a team and had fun while doing it.

NWO is a stealth game developed in Java using Simple Graphics library. 
The objective is for the player to sneak through the guards and hack the computer terminal. The player can also collect keys and coins in order to get a better score.
We were able to implement our ideas, and seeing the final result really made us proud.

In this project I had the chance to be making the sprites and the in-game music and sounds. We also recorded some of our voices for when the enemy was finally able to detect us, that's how personally invested we were. I remember working on implementing the character's and enemy movement and logic. Besides also helping in implementing the logic behind the  music, sound, animations and sprites, I also helped in some of the enemy detection and game mechanics.
